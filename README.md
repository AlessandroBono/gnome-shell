# GNOME Shell

GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME desktop,
like switching to windows and launching applications. GNOME Shell takes
advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware and introduces
innovative user interface concepts to provide a visually attractive and
easy to use experience.

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME [bug tracking system][bug-tracker].
Please refer to the [*Schedule* wiki page][schedule] to see the supported versions.

All interactions with the project should follow the [Code of Conduct][conduct].

## Contributing

To contribute, open merge requests at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell.

Commit messages should follow the [GNOME commit message
guidelines](https://wiki.gnome.org/Git/CommitMessages). If a merge request
fixes an existing issue, it is good practice to append the full issue URL
to each commit message. Try to always prefix commit subjects with a relevant
topic, such as `panel:` or `status/network:`, and it's always better to write
too much in the commit message body than too little.
