# GNOME Shell

GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME desktop,
like switching to windows and launching applications. GNOME Shell takes
advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware and introduces
innovative user interface concepts to provide a visually attractive and
easy to use experience.

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME [bug tracking system][bug-tracker].

All interactions with the project should follow the [Code of Conduct][conduct].

## Supported versions

Upstream gnome-shell only supports the most recent stable release series,
the previous stable release series, and the current development release
series. Any older stable release series are no longer supported, although
they may still receive backported security updates in long-term support
distributions. Such support is up to the distributions, though.

Please refer to the [schedule] to see when a new version will be released.
